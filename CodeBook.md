##CODE BOOK
#DISCLAIMER: This markdown file is a codebook that contains the information on the variables, data set, transformations and work that was done to tidy up the data.

###LIBRARIES
#1. data.table - offers fast and memory efficient: file reader and writer, aggregations, updates, equi, non-equi, rolling, range and interval joins, in a short and flexible syntax, for faster development
#2. dplyr - provides a flexible grammar of data manipulation. It's the next iteration of plyr, focused on tools for working with data frames (hence the d in the name)
