## LIBRARIES
1. data.table - offers fast and memory efficient: file reader and writer, aggregations, updates, equi, non-equi, rolling, range and interval joins, in a short and flexible syntax, for faster development
2. dplyr - provides a flexible grammar of data manipulation. It's the next iteration of plyr, focused on tools for working with data frames (hence the d in the name)

#DATA SET INFORMATION
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

##DATA SET FILES
1.'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
2.'features.txt': List of all features.
3.'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.

1.'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
2.'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.
3.'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.
4.'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.

##FEATURE INFORMATION
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

*tBodyAcc-XYZ
*tGravityAcc-XYZ
*tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
*tBodyGyro-XYZ
*tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
*tBodyAccMag
*tGravityAccMag
*tBodyAccJerkMag
*tBodyGyroMag
*tBodyGyroJerkMag
*fBodyAcc-XYZ
*fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
*fBodyGyro-XYZ
*fBodyAccMag
*fBodyAccJerkMag
*fBodyGyroMag
*fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

*mad(): Median absolute deviation
*max(): Largest value in array

##DATA SET TRANSFORMATION
The following steps were taken in order to come up with the final tidy data set. All the codes were written on the R script entitled, run_analysis.R.

1. Merged the training and the test sets to create one data set. The data sets were loaded, both test and train data, processed them, and merged the results into a single dataset. (DATAFRAME: "DataSet")

2. Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Out of all the variables, the mean and standard deviation data were filtered into one dataset with appropriate column names. (DATAFRAME: "DataSet2")

3. Used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. In addition to the previous steps, the activity labels, feature names and subject were considered to properly make descriptions.

4. Appropriately labeled the data set with descriptive variable names. The appropriate descriptive variable names served as replacement to the large dataset columns (variables). (DATAFRAME: TidyDataSet)

*t > time
*f > frequency
*Acc > Accelerometer
*Gyro > Gyroscope
*Mag > Magnitude
*BodyBody > Body

5. From the data set in step 4, created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The script "run_analysis.R" calculates the average for all measurement columns grouped by variables Activity and Subject and then writes the output to a local text file named "TidyData.txt
